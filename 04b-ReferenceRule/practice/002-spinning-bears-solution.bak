;;PROBLEM:
;;
;;In this problem you will design another world program. In this program the changing 
;;information will be more complex - your type definitions will involve arbitrary 
;;sized data as well as the reference rule and compound data. But by doing your 
;;design in two phases you will be able to manage this complexity. As a whole, this problem 
;;will represent an excellent summary of the material covered so far in the course, and world 
;;programs in particular.
;;
;;This world is about spinning bears. The world will start with an empty screen. Clicking
;;anywhere on the screen will cause a bear to appear at that spot. The bear starts out upright,
;;but then rotates counterclockwise at a constant speed. Each time the mouse is clicked on the 
;;screen, a new upright bear appears and starts spinning.
;;
;;So each bear has its own x and y position, as well as its angle of rotation. And there are an
;;arbitrary amount of bears.
;;
;;To start, design a world that has only one spinning bear. Initially, the world will start
;;with one bear spinning in the center at the screen. Clicking the mouse at a spot on the
;;world will replace the old bear with a new bear at the new spot. You can do this part 
;;with only material up through compound. 
;;
;;Once this is working you should expand the program to include an arbitrary number of bears.
;;
;;Here is an image of a bear for you to use: .

;; Spinning Bears

;; =================
;; Constants:

(define WIDTH 600) ; width of the scene
(define HEIGHT 700) ; height of the scene

(define SPEED 3)  ; speed of rotation

(define MTS (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT)) ; the empty scene

(define BEAR-IMG .)

;; =================
;; Data definitions:

(define-struct bear (x y r))
;; Bear is (make-bear Number[0,WIDTH] Number[0,HEIGHT] Integer)
;; interp.  (make-bear x y r) is the state of a bear, where
;;  x is the x coordinate in pixels,
;;  y is the y coordinate in pixels, and
;;  r is the angle of rotation in degrees

(define B1 (make-bear 0 0 0)) ; bear in the upper left corner

  (... (bear-x b)     ; Number[0,WIDTH]
       (bear-y b)     ; Number[0,HEIGHT]
       (bear-r b)))   ; Integer
