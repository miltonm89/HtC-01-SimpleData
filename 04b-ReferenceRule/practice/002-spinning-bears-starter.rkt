;;PROBLEM:
;;
;;In this problem you will design another world program. In this program the changing 
;;information will be more complex - your type definitions will involve arbitrary 
;;sized data as well as the reference rule and compound data. But by doing your 
;;design in two phases you will be able to manage this complexity. As a whole, this problem 
;;will represent an excellent summary of the material covered so far in the course, and world 
;;programs in particular.
;;
;;This world is about spinning bears. The world will start with an empty screen. Clicking
;;anywhere on the screen will cause a bear to appear at that spot. The bear starts out upright,
;;but then rotates counterclockwise at a constant speed. Each time the mouse is clicked on the 
;;screen, a new upright bear appears and starts spinning.
;;
;;So each bear has its own x and y position, as well as its angle of rotation. And there are an
;;arbitrary amount of bears.
;;
;;To start, design a world that has only one spinning bear. Initially, the world will start
;;with one bear spinning in the center at the screen. Clicking the mouse at a spot on the
;;world will replace the old bear with a new bear at the new spot. You can do this part 
;;with only material up through compound. 
;;
;;Once this is working you should expand the program to include an arbitrary number of bears.
